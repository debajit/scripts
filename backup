# backup - Backs up important files that are generally not in git, git annex, or a BtrFS snapshot.
#
# SYNOPSIS
#   backup
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   Uses borg to backup a variety of important files. These are mostly
#   user-files (with a few important system files for reference) that
#   are typically
#
#   - Not under revision control. This may include important
#     work-in-progress documents (like notes) that have not been
#     synced to the git upstream for instance.
#
#   - Not git-annexed
#
#   - Not backed up by the default BtrFS system snapshots (managed by
#     Timeshift for instance)
