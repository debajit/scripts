# stream-clipboard-url - Stream a video URL in the clipboard
#
# SYNOPSIS
#   Streams the video URL currently in the clipboard.
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   Takes the video or livestream URL in the clipboard and opens it
#   with mpv. mpv allows one to apply several adjustments to the video
#   such as speeding up the audio, or applying color adjustments on
#   the fly (like contrast or saturation).
#
#   Adapted from Kris Occhipintiâ€™s script from
#   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsQuGplQvrw
#
# EXAMPLE
#   stream-clipboard-url
#
# NOTE
#   Tip: you can bind this to a keyboard shortcut to easily open video
#   URLs in mpv with one keystroke.
#
# TODO: Handle the exit status from mpv.
# TODO: Use notification.sh for sending the desktop notification.
# TODO: Make this work on macOS. This has been tested on GNU/Linux only at the moment.
